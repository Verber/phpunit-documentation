  <title>Installing PHPUnit</title>

  <caution>
    <para>
      You are looking at the documentation for a version of PHPUnit that is no
      longer supported.
    </para>

    <para>
      The documentation for the current version of PHPUnit can be found
      <ulink url="../../current/en/index.html">here</ulink>.
    </para>
  </caution>

  <para>
    PHPUnit should be installed using the PEAR Installer, the backbone of the
    <ulink url="http://pear.php.net/">PHP Extension and Application
    Repository</ulink> that provides a distribution system for PHP packages.
  </para>

  <caution>
    <para>
      Depending on your OS distribution and/or your PHP environment, you may
      need to install PEAR or update your existing PEAR installation before
      you can proceed with the instructions in this chapter.
    </para>

    <para>
      <userinput>sudo pear upgrade PEAR</userinput> usually suffices to
      upgrade an existing PEAR installation. The <ulink
      url="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php">PEAR
      Manual</ulink> explains how to perform a fresh installation of PEAR.
    </para>
  </caution>

  <note>
    <para>
      PHPUnit 3.5 requires PHP 5.2.7 (or later) but PHP 5.3.8 (or later) is
      highly recommended.
    </para>

    <para>
      PHP_CodeCoverage, the library that is used by PHPUnit 3.5 to collect and
      process code coverage information, depends on Xdebug 2.0.5 (or later) but
      Xdebug 2.1.2 (or later) is highly recommended.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    The following two commands (which you may have to run as
    <literal>root</literal>) are all that is required to install PHPUnit using
    the PEAR Installer:
  </para>

  <screen><userinput>pear config-set auto_discover 1</userinput>
<userinput>pear install pear.phpunit.de/PHPUnit</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    After the installation you can find the PHPUnit source files inside your
    local PEAR directory; the path is usually
    <filename>/usr/lib/php/PHPUnit</filename>.
  </para>
