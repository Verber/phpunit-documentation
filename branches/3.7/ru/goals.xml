    Пока у нас есть только два теста для встроенного типа <literal>array</literal>
    и функции <literal>count()</literal>. Если мы начнём тестирование
    многочисленных функций <literal>array_ *() </literal> которые предоставляет PHP нам должны будем
    написать тест для каждой из них. Мы могли бы написать инфраструктуру для
    всех эти тестов с нуля. Однако, гораздо лучше написать один раз тестовую инфраструктуру,
    а затем писать только уникальные части каждого теста.
    PHPUnit как раз и является такой инфраструктурой.

    Такой фреймворк как PHPUnit должен соответствовать ряду требований, некоторые
    из конторых кажутся противоречивыми. Одновременно тесты должны быть:

    A framework such as PHPUnit has to resolve a set of constraints, some of
    which seem always to conflict with each other. Simultaneously, tests

          Tests do not generally require all the flexibility of a programming
          language. Many testing tools provide their own scripting language
          that only includes the minimum necessary features for writing tests.
          The resulting tests are easy to read and write because they have no
          noise to distract you from the content of the tests. However,
          learning yet another programming language and set of programming
          tools is inconvenient and clutters the mind.

          If you want the results of one test to have no effect on the results
          of another test, each test should create the full state of the world
          before it begins to execute and return the world to its original
          state when it finishes. However, setting up the world can take a
          long time: for example connecting to a database and initializing it
          to a known state using realistic data.

  <para>
    PHPUnit attempts to resolve these conflicts by using PHP as the testing
    language. Sometimes the full power of PHP is overkill for writing little
    straight-line tests, but by using PHP we leverage all the experience and
    tools programmers already have in place. Since we are trying to convince
    reluctant testers, lowering the barrier to writing those initial tests
    is particularly important.
  </para>

  <para>
    PHPUnit errs on the side of isolation over quick execution. Isolated
    tests are valuable because they provide high-quality feedback. You do
    not get a report with a bunch of test failures, which were really caused
    because one test at the beginning of the suite failed and left the world
    messed up for the rest of the tests. This orientation towards isolated
    tests encourages designs with a large number of simple objects. Each
    object can be tested quickly in isolation. The result is better designs
    <emphasis>and</emphasis> faster tests.
  </para>

  <para>
    PHPUnit assumes that most tests succeed and it is not worth reporting
    the details of successful tests. When a test fails, that fact is worth
    noting and reporting. The vast majority of tests should succeed and are
    not worth commenting on except to count the number of tests that run.
    This is an assumption that is really built into the reporting classes,
    and not into the core of PHPUnit. When the results of a test run are
    reported, you see how many tests were executed, but you only see details
    for those that failed.
  </para>

  <para>
    Tests are expected to be fine-grained, testing one aspect of one object.
    Hence, the first time a test fails, execution of the test halts, and
    PHPUnit reports the failure. It is an art to test by running in many
    small tests. Fine-grained tests improve the overall design of the system.
  </para>

  <para>
    When you test an object with PHPUnit, you do so only through the
    object's public interface. Testing based only on publicly visible
    behaviour encourages you to confront and solve difficult design problems
    earlier, before the results of poor design can infect large parts of the
    system.
