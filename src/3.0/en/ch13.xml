      You are looking at the documentation for a version of PHPUnit that is no
      longer supported.

    You have learned how to use unit tests to test your code. But how do you
    test your tests? How do you find code that is not yet tested -- or, in
    other words, not yet <emphasis>covered</emphasis> by a test? How do you
    measure testing completeness? All these questions are answered by a
    practice called Code-Coverage Analysis. Code-Coverage Analysis gives you
    an insight into what parts of the production code are executed when the
    tests are run.

    PHPUnit's Code-Coverage Analysis utilizes the statement coverage
    functionality provided by the <ulink url="http://www.xdebug.org/">Xdebug</ulink>
    extension. An example of what statement coverage means is that if there is
    a method with 100 lines of code, and only 75 of these lines are actually
    executed when tests are being run, then the method is considered to have a
    code coverage of 75 percent.

  <para>
    <xref linkend="code-coverage-analysis.figures.Code_Coverage.png" /> shows
    an excerpt from a Code Coverage report. Lines of code that were executed
    while running the tests are highlighted green, lines of code that are
    executable but were not executed are highlighted red, and "dead code" is
    highlighted orange. The number left to the actual line of code indicates
    how many tests cover that line.

  <para>
    The code-coverage report for our <literal>BankAccount</literal> example
    shows that we do not have any tests yet that call the
    <literal>setBalance()</literal>, <literal>depositMoney()</literal>, and
    <literal>withdrawMoney()</literal> methods with legal values.
    <xref linkend="code-coverage-analysis.examples.BankAccountTest.php" />
    shows tests that need to be added to the <literal>BankAccountTest</literal>
    test-case class to completely cover the <literal>BankAccount</literal>
    class.
